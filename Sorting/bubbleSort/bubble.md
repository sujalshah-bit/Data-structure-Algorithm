Sure, let's provide a more structured explanation, along with Java code, for each version of Bubble Sort, including their time and space complexities.

**1. Basic Bubble Sort (Worst Version):**

**Intuition:**
- Basic Bubble Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm.
- It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- This process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.
- It is not efficient for large datasets but serves as a fundamental sorting concept.

**Code (Java):**

```java
public class BubbleSort {
    public static void basicBubbleSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity (Basic Bubble Sort):**
- Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2) when the list is in reverse order.
- Best-case time complexity: O(n) when the list is already sorted.
- Average-case time complexity: O(n^2).

**Space Complexity (Basic Bubble Sort):**
- Space complexity: O(1) because Bubble Sort sorts the list in place without using additional memory.

**2. Optimized Bubble Sort (Better Version):**

**Intuition:**
- Optimized Bubble Sort improves the basic version by adding a flag to check if any swaps were made in an iteration.
- If no swaps are made, it means the list is already sorted, and the algorithm terminates early.

**Code (Java):**

```java
public class BubbleSort {
    public static void optimizedBubbleSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        boolean swapped;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            swapped = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }
            if (!swapped) {
                break; // If no swaps were made, the list is already sorted.
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity (Optimized Bubble Sort):**
- Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2) when the list is in reverse order.
- Best-case time complexity: O(n) when the list is already sorted.
- Average-case time complexity: O(n^2).

**Space Complexity (Optimized Bubble Sort):**
- Space complexity: O(1).

**3. Cocktail Shaker Sort (Best Version):**

**Intuition:**
- Cocktail Shaker Sort (Bidirectional Bubble Sort) sorts in both directions, reducing the number of passes needed.
- It starts at both ends and moves towards the center, swapping elements if needed.
- This variation performs better in practice compared to the basic version.

**Code (Java):**

```java
public class BubbleSort {
    public static void cocktailShakerSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        boolean swapped;
        int start = 0;
        int end = n - 1;
        while (swapped) {
            swapped = false;
            
            // Pass from left to right
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
                if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                    // Swap arr[i] and arr[i+1]
                    int temp = arr[i];
                    arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
                    arr[i + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }
            if (!swapped) {
                break; // If no swaps were made, the list is already sorted.
            }
            
            swapped = false;
            end--; // Reduce the end index
            
            // Pass from right to left
            for (int i = end - 1; i >= start; i--) {
                if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                    // Swap arr[i] and arr[i+1]
                    int temp = arr[i];
                    arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
                    arr[i + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }
            start++; // Increment the start index
        }
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity (Cocktail Shaker Sort):**
- Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2) when the list is in reverse order.
- Best-case time complexity: O(n) when the list is already sorted.
- Average-case time complexity: O(n^2).

**Space Complexity (Cocktail Shaker Sort):**
- Space complexity: O(1).

These versions of Bubble Sort demonstrate the trade-offs between simplicity and efficiency, with optimized and bidirectional versions providing better performance while maintaining the basic sorting concept.




**Bubble Sort Intuition:**

Bubble Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. Here's a breakdown of the what, why, and how of Bubble Sort:

1. What is Bubble Sort?
   - Bubble Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.
   - It's called "Bubble Sort" because smaller elements "bubble" to the top (beginning) of the list while larger elements sink to the bottom (end).

2. Why Bubble Sort?
   - Bubble Sort is primarily used for educational purposes or for sorting small lists.
   - It's not efficient for large datasets but is easy to understand and implement.
   - It helps grasp the fundamental concept of sorting algorithms and how they work.

3. How Bubble Sort Works:
   - Start at the beginning of the list and compare the first two elements.
   - If they are out of order (e.g., the first element is greater than the second), swap them.
   - Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swap if necessary.
   - Continue this process, moving through the list one element at a time, until no more swaps are needed.
   - After each pass, the largest unsorted element will have "bubbled" to the end of the list.
   - Repeat the process for n-1 passes, where n is the number of elements in the list.


**Time and Space Complexity of Bubble Sort:**
- Time Complexity:
  - Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2) when the list is in reverse order, and we need to perform n-1 passes with n elements.
  - Best-case time complexity: O(n) when the list is already sorted, but the algorithm still needs to perform the comparisons.
  - Average-case time complexity: O(n^2).
- Space Complexity: O(1) because Bubble Sort sorts the list in place and does not require additional memory other than a few variables for loop control and swapping.
